## Overview

Civitas Network is built with a focus on:
- **Security & Transparency:** Through integrated KYC and non-custodial wallet solutions.
- **Innovative Tokenomics:** A mathematically-driven model for virtual mining, tiered staking rewards, and team vesting.
- **Community Empowerment:** Designed for the people, by the peopleâ€”our decentralized governance ensures a voice for every participant.

## Key Features

- **EVM Compatibility:**  
  Leveraging Solidity to ensure compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem and existing development tools.

- **Advanced Token Distribution Model:**  
  - **Virtual Mining:**  
    Early adopters earn virtual tokens through a time-decay reward mechanism before the mainnet launch.
  - **Staking Rewards:**  
    Tiered rewards based on lock-up durations (1, 3, 5, and 8 years) using a mathematically-tuned multiplier.
  - **Team Vesting:**  
    A 1-year cliff followed by linear vesting over 3 years, ensuring long-term alignment with project success.

- **Integrated KYC & Wallet Solutions:**  
  Users can create non-custodial wallets with built-in KYC verification, allowing for both anonymous and verified transactions.

- **Robust Security & Governance:**  
  Multi-sig administrative controls and decentralized governance mechanisms maintain a secure, transparent network.

## Tokenomics

Our native token, **Civitas Token (CVT)**, plays a central role in the Civitas Network ecosystem:
- **Staking & Rewards:**  
  Stake CVT for tiered APY rewards.
- **Transaction Fees:**  
  CVT is used to pay for transaction fees on the network.
- **Governance:**  
  Token holders participate in voting on key network proposals.
- **Incentives:**  
  Early participation is incentivized through our virtual mining mechanism.
